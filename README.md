# Youth-Finance-Institute-of-America-2023
Youth Finance Institue of America (YFIA) is a nonprofit focused on supporting youth with financial education. I was hired for YFIA as a summer intern associate where I gave various in person and virtual presentations on financial education topics such as budgeting. My personalized project during the summer focused on the following: 

Data management revamp
- Restructured and optimized in-person workshop data management and analysis workflow by developing a comprehensive Google Spreadsheets template
- Designed multiple sub-sheets for efficient storage of in-person workshop student data, enabling streamlined and automated analysis of test score improvement, student sentiment trends, and demographic insights utilizing Google API queries

I have been hired back as a cnotract worker due to my success in the summer with updating data analysis systems and will update accordingly based on future work!
